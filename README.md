# kevalib
Kevalib is the core utility and foundational crate by KevaLabs, designed to support the development of robust, scalable Rust applications.

It provides a collection of reusable modules, including common value objects (like Money, DateRange, Email, PhoneNumber), validation utilities, ID generators, error types, and more — all thoughtfully crafted to reduce duplication and enforce domain integrity.

Whether you’re building APIs, services, or domain-driven systems, Kevalib serves as your shared building block for clean, consistent, and efficient application development.
